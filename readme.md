I chose to show earthquakes between August 1 and August 5 of 2025, and I chose to show all earthquakes greater than 1 magnitude. Before making this map, I did not realize how many earthquakes occur! I had to continually change the date range and the magnitude in order not to have too much data overwhelm the map.  

This third map shows the combined weather radar/alerts and earthquake data.
